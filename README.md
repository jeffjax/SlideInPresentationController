SlideInPresentationController
=============================
Demonstrates a simple iOS 8 Presentation Controller written in Swift. The controller slides the presented view controller in from the bottom much like an action sheet. 

The sample app uses a popover if the current horizontal size class is not compact. Otherwise it uses the custom presentation controller.
